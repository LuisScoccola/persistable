Persistent and stable clustering (Persistable) is a density-based clustering algorithm intended for exploratory data analysis.
What distinguishes Persistable from other clustering algorithms is its visualization capabilities.
Persistable's interactive mode lets you visualize multi-scale and multi-density cluster structure present in the data.
This is used to guide the choice of parameters that lead to the final clustering.


## Usage

Here is a brief outline of the main functionality; see the [documentation](https://persistable.readthedocs.io/) for details, including the [API reference](https://persistable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html).

In order to run Persistable's interactive mode from a Jupyter notebook, run the following in a Jupyter cell:

```python
import persistable
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

X = make_blobs(2000, centers=4, random_state=1)[0]

p = persistable.Persistable(X)
pi = persistable.PersistableInteractive(p)
pi.start_ui()
```

The last command returns the port in `localhost` serving the UI, which is `8050` by default.
Now go to `localhost:8050` in your web browser to access the graphical user interface:

After choosing your parameters using the user interface, you can get your clustering in another Jupyter cell by running:

```python
clustering_labels = pi.cluster()
```

**Note:** You may use `pi.start_ui(jupyter_mode="inline")` to have the graphical user interface display directly in the Jupyter notebook!


## Installing

Make sure you are using Python 3.
Persistable depends on the following python packages, which will be installed automatically when you install with `pip`:
`numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `cython`, `plotly`, `dash`, `diskcache`, `multiprocess`, `psutil`.
To install from pypi, simply run the following:

```bash
pip install persistable-clustering
```

## Running the tests

You can run the tests by running the following commands from the root directory of a clone of this repository.
If a test fails, please [report a bug](https://github.com/LuisScoccola/persistable/issues/new), trying to include as much information as possible, including your system's information, warnings, logs, screenshots, and anything else you think may be of use.

```bash
pip install pytest playwright pytest-playwright
python -m playwright install --with-deps
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m setup build_ext --inplace
pytest .
```


## Details about theory and implementation

Persistable is based on multi-parameter persistence [[4]](#4), a method from topological data analysis.
The theory behind Persistable is developed in [[1]](#1), while this implementation uses the high performance algorithms for density-based clustering developed in [[2]](#2) and implemented in [[3]](#3).
Persistable's interactive mode is inspired by RIVET [[5]](#5) and is implemented in [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/).
